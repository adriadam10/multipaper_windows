This script enables non-expert people to create a [Multipaper](https://github.com/MultiPaper/MultiPaper) node.
The script prompts the user for the master server, name, and allocated memory, and then creates the server on a randomly assigned port that automatically opens using UPnP (thanks to portmapper).
All the data prompted is saved in txt files inside the project folder.

PD: i'm only a bored boy in summer trying new things
